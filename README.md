### WTF?

This is my attempt to implement Transit data interchange format (https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format) in Haskell.

Most of the Transit core functionality isn't yet implemented and some parts won't be implemented at all.

Based on Transit (https://github.com/jstepien/transit) by Jan Stępień.
